# Car-Accident-Project
Using the Database of the SDOT Traffic Management Division of Seattle, the main objectives of this project are: 
  1. To build a Classification model that can predict the probability of one of these type of accidents (property damage or injury). 
  2. To get a better understanding of the key factors involved in road crashes.
